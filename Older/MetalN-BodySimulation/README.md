# Metal N-Body Simulation

Performs an N-body simulation which calculates a gravity field and corresponding velocity and acceleration contributions accumulated by each body in the system from every other body. This further demonstrates performant techniques for compute kernel generating visualization data for the fragment and vertex stages in the Metal render pipeline.
